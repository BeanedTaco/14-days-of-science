# 14 Days of Science

A little project created by [Danny](https://bean.codes), [Woofie](https://woofie.lightson.xyz), and [Jake](). During the Christmas Holidays of 2020, every day for 2 weeks, we will each be creating a project that's fun, resourceful, educational, or scientific. Each day's project is a surprise, and will be gradually revealed as the 14 days go by. 

The first project was by Danny on 19 December. He will not be doing a project every day due to time issues and motivation. (lol)
